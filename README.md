# RISCV-verilog-main
In this project, I designed and developed a disk analyzer for Linux. Its purpose is to scan your file system structure and graphically represent the directory entries with emphasis on size occupied by each entry. It has the capability to zoom in/out on selected entries (i.e., moving in or out from partitions to subdirectories to files).
